### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer primarily focused on back-end and database technologies. Currently, I'm deeply immersed in projects aimed at crafting robust and scalable systems.

ðŸ”­ Right now, my efforts are centered around enhancing my skills in back-end development, ensuring that my applications are efficient and secure.

ðŸŒ± Additionally, I'm dedicating time to advancing my knowledge in Python and JavaScript, two pivotal languages in the programming world that have been instrumental to my professional growth.
